*The following is an extended example of an AI product from inception to incident and how the AI Incident database has a role in every step of the product cycle. The product centers on RoboticsGlobal, a fictional future robotics company.*

**February 6th, 2031 - Product definition**  
RoboticsGlobal (RG) dominates the warehouse pick and pack industry after developing the first plug-and-play completely automated warehouses. RG learned from the history of robot accidents at fulfillment centers and stop their Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) whenever they are in the presence of humans. Now, they would like to dominate the in-home care space with "Kerrie," a bot supporting elder independence by completing in-home tasks that require coordination and strength beyond elder capacity.

RG believes they have finally figured out how to appropriately deploy large AMRs in homes. Every Kerrie will ship with a localized version of RGSim, which provides photorealistic renderings of the environment to the robot's perception and planning subsystems. These simulations serve to ensure the robot can navigate the home environment, but they also provide the ability for Kerrie to show complete execution plans to humans for approval. Any sufficiently complex activity requires human review of the simulated execution plan before Kerrie proceeds.

Having cracked the home planning safety problem through an intuitive review interface, RG is very excited for Kerrie and has forecast sales in the millions. Their enthusiasm is only tempered by what they know to be a long engineering and assurance effort for bringing Kerrie to market. A history of tech companies moving too fast to market has produced a variety of statutory and regulatory requirements gating release to market. To reduce the time to market, the product staff begins by including a collection of incidents from the AI Incident Database's (AIID's) now 14 billion incident reports across 805 thousand distinct incidents. These incident reports are a mixture of popular press (703k reports), academic (8k reports), mandatory company reports/responses (23k reports), and programmatic incident reports automatically streamed to the AIID from the field (the remainder of the 14 billion reports).

RG product managers run a series of queries on both in-home care robotics and Kerrie's perception, simulation, and planning components. The queries produce a list of 230 potential incidents, that are bundled together into a checklist for the engineering team to prevent or mitigate in the design of Kerrie.

**March 17th, 2031 - Product Engineering**  
The engineering staff producing Kerrie have a tall order, but they already have the components and subsystems built for the robot, RGSim, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). What they don't have is a history of operating in the home environment. Thus their engineering effort is primarily focused on contextualizing Kerrie to the home environment, testing for edge cases, and putting appropriate safeguards in place. Two Kerrie test teams have been formed. Both teams digest AI incident data sourced from the AIID to form test scenarios, but while one of the test teams is integrated with the engineering staff, the other is a "red team" that creates the go-or-no-go collection of tests based on their own read of the AI incident data. The red team summaries of results are provided on a scheduled basis to the engineering team, but the test set is never provided or described to the engineering staff.

After 18 months of intensive effort, Kerrie is finally ready to be brought to market. However, before they are allowed to ship to any markets, they must first prove Kerrie's safety and effectiveness by getting sign off from an external party recognized by various governments in statute and regulation. 

**August 15th, 2033 - US Audit**  
Kerrie is not the first in-home care robot to seek approval for the market. Several similar robots have gone through audit processes run by independent organizations with deep process and technical experience for assurance and test. IntelligentAudits (IA) is one such auditor and has performed four audits in the past for RG's competitors. In each instance they have expanded their assurance checklists from incidents sourced from countries that require no assurance processes whatsoever. Incident reports sourced from around the world are machine-translated  and audit firms like IA get notifications whenever something new matching their selectors is ingested. These incidents are then classified according to their properties by the audit community, and incorporated into audits whereby new products are validated. In the United States,  such assessments have the force of law. Past recorded incidents must be evaluated for their probability of recurrence by Kerrie, the auditor then provides a report of Kerrie's contexts, capacities, and risks to the National Council of Robotics, which has the power to block shipping Kerrie unless the robot makes adequate efforts to prevent or mitigate the full list of incidents.

**May 1st, 2034 - Regulatory Approval**  
The National Council of Robotics is one of several regulatory agencies within the United States gating the release of AI products to the market. There are similar bodies for non-embodied models such as voice agents, synthetic media, and natural language processing, among others. Each develops their own technical and domain expertise, coordinates with other world regulatory bodies, issues recalls, and has a broad mandate to ensure intelligent systems produce a better society. After requesting and receiving additional information from IA on the matter of Kerrie, the National Robotics Council completes its review and issues a preliminary license to ship 1k paid robots to market.

**May 1st, 2034 - Go2Market**  
After three years, RG is excited to finally bring Kerrie to market. They issue a press release and the initial authorized run of 1k robots sells out immediately. A month later, the Kerries begin arriving with consumers and the over-the-top enthusiasm on YouTube shows there is a bright future for the robot.

**October 14th, 2034 - Incident**  
One of the major selling points for Kerrie is the "wellness check" functionality, which will automatically page emergency services should its elder become incapacitated. To prevent erroneous emergency responses, the wellness checks only run if the elder is alone and non-responsive. When Harold Jorkins collapsed as an independent living 93 year old in the presence of Kerrie, he believed his faithful robot would perform the wellness check and phone for help. However, Kerrie did not perform the wellness check because it believed there was another person in the home with Harold. Why? With increasingly commonplace deployments of deep learning based perceptual systems, people now play adversarial games with computer vision systems. One common approach is attaching adversarially-crafted stickers to objects so their class label would be changed from one object to another. With the arrival of Harold's Kerrie, a grandson began playing adversarial games with the robot, including placing a sticker on the microwave that transformed it in Kerrie's eyes from an appliance to a person. Now, faced with a collapsed Harold, Kerrie was content to allow the microwave to handle the situation.

**October 15th, 2034 - Incident Report**  
Thankfully Harold survived his collapse and wants to know what happened with Kerrie. He authorizes Kerrie to publicly disclose the perceptual data and system state history to the AI Incident database, which will be archived along with the "post mortem" findings required of RG by mandatory reporting standards. The National Council of Robotics investigates, issues findings which are archived in the AIID, and requires a mitigation from RG be entered into the incident record alongside the reporting. The AIID also programmatically pings the open source dataset repository used to train Kerrie's perceptual system along with the open source object recognition model which Kerrie relies on. Both those resources link back to the AIID as the system of record for data properties and model quality. All companies in the robotics space are thus on notice that they have an additional entry for their assessments. As competitors in Europe begin shipping a robot similar to Kerrie, the incident of failed wellness checks will not be repeated.
